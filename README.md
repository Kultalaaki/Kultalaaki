## 2014 - 2020
I started to learn programming. I had one idea and that was to make app for volunteer firefighters in Finland.
First I discussed this idea with few friends and they thought it might not work the way I wanted.
Second problem was that I didn't know any programmming at all.
I started to learn Java through [MOOC](https://www.mooc.fi/en/) course of Helsinki University. Oh boy.. I was so enthusiastic when I got started.
Without knowing any programming at all it was kinda hard to get going. 
When I got through first six week of the course, or maybe five and a half, in that point, I was so confident that I started to tinker with Android Studio.

Few first tries in Android Studio got somehow scrambled because I didn't know what I was doing. Youtube to the rescue and slowly I got my project running.
In couple months project VPK Apuri started really going forward. I totally forgot the MOOC course, biggest mistake that I have made.
When I launched VPK Apuri to the Play Store I didn't even promote it in anyway, but somehow people still founded it.
Slowly but surely the word got out and many volunteer firefighters in Finland were very excited about it.
From the beginning the app has had the best feature and the reason I made it, to pick the address from SMS and show it on Google Maps or some other map program. 
Check the [VPK Apuri repo](https://github.com/Kultalaaki/VPKApuri) if you're interested.

Android keeps evolving very fast. When I started there wasn't runtime permissions, **everything** was allowed.
I think it was 2018 when my app got kicked out of the Play Store because it uses dangerous permission (reading/ writing sms).
This has to be approved by Google and many times I tried to get permission from Google but they didn't see my app as useful as I have hoped.
Now this app is open source for everyone to see what is happening under the hood.
After kickout I made website to host my app and kept it one year. There was just too much going on in my life at that point so i didn't have strength 
to keep it up. I didn't abandon my users, as there was constant flow of emails because many phone makers have put so restrictive measures on how apps can work in background.

**Biggest** mistake and how it has affected. 
Well.. I had learned little how to program. I really didn't know how to do it "right".
When making VPK Apuri I just used what I knew from the first six weeks of MOOC Java course. 
I didn't know how to really utilize OOP. That reason alone affected the outcome in a way that it made progressing the app very difficult.
My files became hard to change because of so much things going on in same class.

## 2021
I bought new laptop and decided to work my way through the MOOC Java course. Under two months I got through it. 
After that I started learning fundamentals of databases. I haven't done all the assignments from that course but that wasn't even my goal, 
just to get to know the basics.

## 2022
I have started MASSIVE redoing of VPK Apuri. Slowly making progress to make my app stand up to standards.

I have three kids (13, 11 and 1), fulltime job in H√§meenkyr√∂n kunta as a construction worker and my hobby as a volunteer firefighter.
At my job I also do on call work every eight week.
In H√§meenkyr√∂n VPK I am a group leader, member of the board and responsible person of RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft System) action.
Group leaders in VPK are responsible to plan and keep weekly training to other members and in alarm situations to be leader of the unit.

In spare time I try to learn programming as much I can. 

‚ú®I'm looking programming jobs to make career change to be a fulltime developer.‚ú®
